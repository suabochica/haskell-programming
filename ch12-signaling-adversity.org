#+TITLE: Signaling Adversity
#+DESCRIPTION: Thank goodness we don't have only serius problems, but ridiculous ones as well
#+AUTHOR: Sergio BenÃ­tez

* Outline
The chapter will include:
- ~Nothing~, or ~Just Maybe~
- ~Either~ left or right, but not both
- higher-kindedness
- anamorphisms, but not animorphs

* Signaling adversity

* Love ~Nothing~
  
* Bleating ~Either~ 

* Kinds, a thousand stars in your types

* Definitions
1. A higher kinded type is any type whose kind has a function arrow in it and which can be described
as a type constructor rather than a type constant:

Example of higher kind:

#+begin_src haskell
Maybe  :: * -> *
[]     :: * -> *
Either :: * -> * -> *
[->]     :: * -> * -> *
#+end_src

Example of not higher kind:

#+begin_src haskell
Int    :: *
Char   :: *
String :: *
[Char] :: *
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
Note: This is not to be confused with higher kinded /polymorphism/
#+end_quote
