  Foldable, Traversable, Reader, State, and Parsers are not strictly necessary
to understanding and using Haskell.

* Outline
- the ~Reader~ context
- examine the Functor, Applicative, and Monad instances for /functions/;
- the ~Reader~ newtype;
- ~fmaps~ galore, and not just on list;
- examples using ~Reader~

* Reader context
  When writing applications, programmers often need to pass around some
information that may be needed intermittently or universally throughout an
entire application.

Pass this information as functions arguments is not enough because it would be
present in the type of almost every function. This will make the code harder to
read and harder to maintain. To address this, we use the *Reader* Monad.
